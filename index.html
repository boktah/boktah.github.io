<h1>Hello!</h1>
<p>
  My name is Taha Bokhari. This is a blog made to detail the many things I have been doing recently, done in the past, and plan on doing in the future.
  Please forgive the unfinished look of the site, I'm teaching myself HTML/CSS and construction of the blog is still a work in progress.
  Check out the Blog tab at the top to read my first blog post ever, <a href="/_posts/2019-06-15-welcome.md">"Welcome"</a>!
