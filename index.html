<h1>{{ "Hello!" }}</h1>
<p>
  This is a blog made to detail the many things I, Taha Bokhari, have been doing recently, have done in the past, and plan on doing in the future.
  Please forgive the unfinished look of the site, I'm teaching myself HTML/CSS and construction of the blog is still a work in progress.
  Check out the Blog tab at the top to read my first blog post ever, "Welcome"!
