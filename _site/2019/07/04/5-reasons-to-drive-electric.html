            <h1>5 Reasons To Drive Electric</h1>
<p>04 Jul 2019 - Taha Bokhari</p>

<div id="fullpost">
    <p>Hi everyone, and happy Fourth of July! Today I’ll be talking about electric cars, and why they are the future of the automobile industry. I’m sure you’ve heard of Tesla and the very… <em>controversial</em>  business practices of its CEO, Elon Musk. There seems to be a never-ending battle between stockholders on whether Tesla is doomed to bankruptcy or whether Musk is the modern Henry Ford. However, regardless of your opinions on Tesla, almost every major automobile manufacturer in the US - including Toyota, Honda, Ford, Nissan, and Volkswagen - understands that electric vehicles (EVs) are the cars of the future, and have implemented goals to increase EV production over the next 5-10 years. Although I’ve never personally owned a battery-powered vehicle, I’ve done a lot of research over the past couple months as part of my internship at the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality (NC DEQ). I’ve learned quite a bit about EVs, and seen a lot of the controversy surrounding the topic first-hand. So today I would like to explain what EVs are, and give 5 reasons that you should strongly consider one as your next car.</p>

<h3 id="1-ev-infrastructure-is-growing">1. EV Infrastructure is Growing</h3>
<p>Obviously, electric vehicles have been something of a novelty until very recently, and even now many people have concerns that the infrastructure just isn’t there yet. One of the biggest examples of this concern is range anxiety: the fear that your electric car won’t have enough range to get you to your destination or even the nearest charging station. However, EV infrastructure is currently booming across the country, making range anxiety an irrelevant concern. California is well known for its industry-leading approach towards the early adoption of EVs, but the same progress is being made in other states in the US as well. North Carolina, for instance, is planning on <a href="https://deq.nc.gov/node/88133" title="NC DEQ: VW Settlement Phase 1">distributing millions of dollars in grants</a> to businesses, nonprofits, and government agencies to install more charging stations along primary highways and corridors. As this growth increases, charging stations will become just as common as gas stations - and as the technology advances, charging times will shorten as well.</p>

<h3 id="2-environmental-impact">2. Environmental Impact</h3>
<p>At face value, this seems like a pretty straightforward point - electric cars don’t use gas, so they don’t emit any carbon dioxide or contribute to NOx pollution. However, there is a lot of misinformation and confusion surrounding the subject. Many people claim that electric cars are actually worse for the environment because of the resources needed to mine the lithium used in the batteries, as well as the fossil fuels burned to generate the electricity used to charge an electric car. In fact, there is some truth to this claim; the initial construction of an EV does have a larger carbon footprint than the construction of a traditional gas vehicle. However, even taking the production of electricity into account, EVs are much friendlier to the environment during their lifetime - therefore, it takes only a few years of driving electric for your EV to become more eco-friendly than your gas vehicle. This information is all derived from studies conducted by the EPA - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RhtiPefVzM" title="Are Electric Cars Worse For The Environment? Myth Busted">this</a> video does a great job of explaining all the statistics and their meaning.</p>

<h3 id="3-theyre-fun-to-drive">3. They’re Fun to Drive</h3>
<p>Aside from the environmental benefits of driving electric, many EVs are simply fun to drive. One of the biggest differences in drive performance between gas and electric cars is the acceleration. An electric vehicle has instant acceleration from 0 mph (that’s 0 kph for our non-American readers), in contrast to the gradual acceleration of gas cars. This is because in an EV, the battery is hooked up directly to the electric motor (with an inverter in between for controlling speed and converting DC to AC). Another unique aspect of EVs is the sound - or rather, lack of sound. With no engine, there is no revving or idling noise. In fact, most EVs play fake accelerating noises through speakers just to keep pedestrians aware of your car’s presence.</p>

<p>Now, I promised myself that I wouldn’t give Tesla any special treatment in this article, but their cars have a lot of innovative and modern features that, in my opinion, really highlight the possible future of the automobile industry. From the smart navigation system that plans your travel routes to coincide with Tesla Supercharger stations, to the extremely minimalistic and clean interior design, to the large, responsive infotainment system, everything about the Tesla Model 3 seems visually pleasing, intuitive, and high-tech. That’s not to mention Tesla’s industry-leading lane-keeping technology and (almost) fully-autonomous mode. All these special features make the Tesla Model 3 my dream car - if only the price was a bit lower.</p>

<h3 id="4-battery-prices-are-declining">4. Battery Prices are Declining</h3>
<p>… I believe that’s what’s called a segue. My biggest gripe with EVs right now is that most of them cost too much. Luckily, this problem will fix itself as time passes. Currently, a large portion of the cost of an EV comes from the lithium-ion battery powering it. As the industry grows, battery prices have been falling dramatically. In 2015, 57% of an EVs cost came from its battery; now, the battery only accounts for 33% of the car’s cost, and this figure is expected to continue to decrease. In fact, according to a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-04-12/electric-vehicle-battery-shrinks-and-so-does-the-total-cost" title="Electric Car Price Tag Shrinks Along With Battery Cost">recent study</a> conducted by BloombergNEF, electric cars will be cheaper than gas cars within the next decade - and the crossover point could be reached by some vehicles in as little as 3 years. This, in my opinion, is the biggest sign that the future of the automobile industry lies in the electric vehicle.</p>

<h3 id="5-incentives-offered-by-local-governments">5. Incentives Offered by Local Governments</h3>
<p>People that already own EVs are called “early adopters,” because they have adopted EV technology before the general public. Many state governments would like to usher in more early adopters and make the EV industry more widespread. To advance this goal, they offer incentives to make it more enticing to buy an EV. These incentives can include tax credits, cash rebates, and quality of life improvements. For example, in North Carolina any plug-in electric car is allowed to drive in HOV lanes, regardless of vehicle occupancy. <a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/electricvehicles/electric-vehicles-tax-credits-and-other-incentives" title="Electric Vehicles: Tax Credits and Other Incentives">This</a> website lists all the incentives offered by the federal government and each state individually. However, these incentives are intended as an initial boost to EV sales, and will likely be struck down as electric cars become more common. If you want to benefit from these incentives, act now.</p>

<p>Well, there you have it. 5 reasons to purchase an electric car as your next vehicle. I feel like the media likes to focus solely on Tesla cars and the huge controversy surrounding them, ignoring the fact that most people don’t have a basic understanding of electric vehicles in the first place and reporting on Tesla only will hurt the entire EV industry. I’ve also noticed, in my time working at NC DEQ so far, that there is a lot of ignorance and misinformation surrounding this topic. Hopefully, this article helped to provide a more complete view of electric cars and why I believe the automobile industry should be leaning heavily towards converting to all-electric cars.</p>
