            <h1>5 Reasons To Drive Electric</h1>
<p>04 Jul 2019 - Taha Bokhari</p>

<div id="fullpost">
    <p>Hi everyone, and happy Fourth of July! Today I’ll be talking about electric cars, and why they are the future of the automobile industry. I’m sure you’ve heard of Tesla and the very… <em>controversial</em>  business practices of its CEO, Elon Musk. There seems to be a never-ending battle between stockholders on whether Tesla is doomed to bankruptcy or whether Musk is the modern Henry Ford. However, regardless of your opinions on Tesla, almost every major automobile manufacturer in the US - including Toyota, Honda, Ford, Nissan, and Volkswagen - understands that electric vehicles (EVs) are the cars of the future, and have implemented goals to increase EV production over the next 5-10 years. Although I’ve never personally owned a battery-powered vehicle, I’ve done a lot of research over the past couple months as part of my internship at the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality (NC DEQ). I’ve learned quite a bit about EVs, and seen a lot of the controversy surrounding the topic first-hand. So today I would like to explain what EVs are, and give 5 reasons that you should strongly consider one as your next car.</p>

<h3 id="1-ev-infrastructure-is-growing">1. EV Infrastructure is Growing</h3>
<p>Obviously, electric vehicles have been something of a novelty until very recently, and even now many people have concerns that the infrastructure just isn’t there yet. One of the biggest examples of this concern is range anxiety: the fear that your electric car won’t have enough range to get you to your destination or even the nearest charging station. However, EV infrastructure is currently booming across the country, making range anxiety an irrelevant concern. California is well known for its industry-leading approach towards the early adoption of EVs, but the same progress is being made in other states in the US as well. North Carolina, for instance, is planning on <a href="https://deq.nc.gov/node/88133" title="NC DEQ: VW Settlement Phase 1">distributing millions of dollars in grants</a> to businesses, nonprofits, and government agencies to install more charging stations along primary highways and corridors. As this growth increases, charging stations will become just as common as gas stations - and as the technology advances, charging times will shorten as well.</p>

<h3 id="2-environmental-impact">2. Environmental Impact</h3>
<p>At face value, this seems like a pretty straightforward point - electric cars don’t use gas, so they don’t emit any carbon dioxide or contribute to NOx pollution. However, there is a lot of misinformation and confusion surrounding the subject. Many people claim that electric cars are actually worse for the environment because of the resources needed to mine the lithium used in the batteries, as well as the fossil fuels burned to generate the electricity used to charge an electric car. In fact, there is some truth to this claim; the initial construction of an EV does have a larger carbon footprint than the construction of a traditional gas vehicle. However, even taking the production of electricity into account, EVs are much friendlier to the environment during their lifetime - therefore, it takes only a few years of driving electric for your EV to become more eco-friendly than your gas vehicle. This information is all derived from studies conducted by the EPA - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RhtiPefVzM" title="Are Electric Cars Worse For The Environment? Myth Busted">this</a> video does a great job of explaining all the statistics and their meaning.</p>
