            <h2>5 Reasons To Drive Electric</h2>
            <p><p>Hi everyone, and happy Fourth of July! Today I’ll be talking about electric cars, and why they are the future of the automobile industry. I’m sure you’ve heard of Tesla and the very… <em>controversial</em>  business practices of its CEO, Elon Musk. There seems to be a never-ending battle between stockholders on whether Tesla is doomed to bankruptcy or whether Musk is the modern Henry Ford. However, regardless of your opinions on Tesla, almost every major automobile manufacturer in the US - including Toyota, Honda, Ford, Nissan, and Volkswagen - understands that electric vehicles (EVs) are the cars of the future, and have implemented goals to increase EV production over the next 5-10 years. Although I’ve never personally owned a battery-powered vehicle, I’ve done a lot of research over the past couple months as part of my internship at the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality (NC DEQ). I’ve learned quite a bit about EVs, and seen a lot of the controversy surrounding the topic first-hand. So today I would like to explain what EVs are, and give 5 reasons that you should strongly consider one as your next car.</p>

            <p><p>Welcome to my little corner of the internet! This site will be a blog all about myself - whatever I’m currently working on, the hobbies I’m spending time on, and some of the interesting stories I’ve picked up throughout high school - plus whatever else happens to cross my mind. First, a little about myself. My name is Taha Bokhari. I just finished my senior year of high school, but will not be graduating just yet - more on that later. I was born here in the USA, but my parents and family are from Pakistan. When I’m not in school I enjoy coding, reading novels, and building robots. I’m also a staunch supporter of the Oxford comma.</p>
