            <p><p>Welcome to my little corner of the internet! This site will be a blog all about myself - whatever I’m currently working on, the hobbies I’m spending time on, and some of the interesting stories I’ve picked up throughout high school - plus whatever else happens to cross my mind. First, a little about myself. My name is Taha Bokhari. I just finished my senior year of high school, but will not be graduating just yet - more on that later. I was born here in the USA, but my parents and family are from Pakistan. When I’m not in school I enjoy coding, reading novels, and building robots. I’m also a staunch supporter of the Oxford comma.</p>
